# Ask-My-Database

Chat with your Postgres database using intuitive natural language queries through an AI-Powered Discord bot. This Python implementation leverages the capabilities of Langchain, ChromaDB, and OpenAI to create a seamless database interaction experience.

## Project Background

This project was specifically developed to address a unique challenge: creating an API capable of receiving app reviews directly from store platforms, transmitted by Zapier. The AI-Powered Discord bot not only provides an interface to the database but also acts as an intermediary, processing and storing incoming reviews efficiently and effectively.

## Features

- **Automated Review Collection**: Automatically receive and store app reviews from store platforms via an API connected to Zapier.
- **Natural Language Queries**: Easily query your Postgres database using the convenience of natural language, without writing complex SQL queries.
- **Langchain Integration**: Utilize Langchain's advanced language processing for understanding and translating queries into database commands.
- **ChromaDB Connectivity**: Manage your database interactions with ChromaDBâ€™s robust functionality.
- **OpenAI Enhancement**: Employ cutting-edge AI from OpenAI for accurate, context-aware natural language processing.
